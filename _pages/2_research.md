## Work in progress


**Ethnic Procurement**  
  (with [Vasily Korovkin](https://sites.google.com/site/vaskorovkin/home) and [Pasha Andreyanov](https://sites.google.com/view/pandreyanov/))  
  - The role of ethnic ties in Russian public procurement auctions
  - Large database of 20 million purchases with information on prices, detailed product categories, bureaucrats etc.
  - Ethnicity of bureaucrats and firm managers is predicted from surnames using a specialized neural network


**Optimal Targeting of Interventions to Reduce Air Pollution**  
*[slides](https://martin-kosiik.github.io/home/files/slides/air_pollution.pdf)*, *[Github repo](https://github.com/martin-kosiik/air_pollution)*
  - I apply air pollution transport modelling (HYSPLIT) to compute the average population exposure to pollution caused by crop residue burning across different locations in North India
  - The results will be used to calculate spatially optimal policy for targeting of interventions to reduce crop residue burning


**Advanced Neural Networks Architectures for Solving Heterogeneous Agent Models**  
  (with Jan Žemlička)  
  - We propose to employ deep lattice networks to develop a modification of the continuous-time value iteration scheme to solve complex incomplete market models
  - The proposed method is explicitly designed to address challenges that arise in the process of approximating high dimensional distributions and value functions
