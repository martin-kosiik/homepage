## Work in progress


**Ethnic Procurement**  
  (with [Vasily Korovkin](https://sites.google.com/site/vaskorovkin/home) and [Pasha Andreyanov](https://sites.google.com/view/pandreyanov/))  
  - The role of ethnic ties in Russian public procurement auctions
  - Large database of 20 million purchases with information on prices, detailed product categories, bureaucrats etc.
  - Ethnicity of bureaucrats and firm managers is predicted from surnames using a specialized neural network


**Optimal Targeting of Interventions to Reduce Air Pollution**  
*[slides](https://martin-kosiik.github.io/homepage/files/slides/air_pollution.pdf)*, *[Github repo](https://github.com/martin-kosiik/air_pollution)*
  - I apply air pollution transport modelling (HYSPLIT) to compute the average population exposure to pollution caused by crop residue burning across different locations in North India
  - The results will be used to calculate spatially optimal policy for targeting of interventions to reduce crop residue burning


**The Effect of Vitamin A and Deworming on Education**  
*[OSF registration](https://osf.io/49tjx)*, *[Pre-analysis plan](https://osf.io/rwt9p)*
- I plan to use administrative and census data to estimate the effects of DEVTA trial on school enrollment and academic achievement 
- DEVTA trial was a large-scale experiment in India which randomized vitamin A supplemtation and deworming treatment to pre-school children to study the effects on health outcomes (see [Awasthi et al. 2012a](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)62125-4/fulltext?version=printerFriendly) and [Awasthi et al. 2012b](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)62126-6/fulltext))
